challenges:
- video contents:
    - multiple faces (very hard to get one face with genuine expressions)
    - people not directly facing the camera
    - glasses, headphones, hats, microphones
    - shaky video
    - lighting
- expressions often happen in well under 1 second
- suprisingly hard to tell for some expressions. Some people/lighting makes it obvious and others make it very difficult
- there's no great definition of an expression
